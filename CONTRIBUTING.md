## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally. (`gt clone gh:<username>/<reponame> --fork gh:SpechtLabs/<reponame>`)
2. Create a branch using the correct prefix: `fix/` for bugfixes or `feature/` for new features. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for determining branch prefixes

---

## Branching and Commit Standards

- Branch names must be descriptive and start with either `fix/` or `feature/`.
  - Example: `fix/login-redirect`, `feature/signup-form`
  - Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for determining branch prefixes

- Commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification:

  ```plaintext
  <type>[optional scope]: <description>

  [optional body]

  [optional footer(s)]

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before opening a pull request:

1. Make sure your branch is targeting `main`
2. Your PR title must be descriptive and **must not include emojis**.
3. Your PR description must explain:
   - **What** you changed.
   - **Why** you made the change.
   - Which issue it closes (use `closes #xxxx` syntax).

4. Make sure all checks pass:
   - `npm run build` (for docs-related changes)
   - `go build ./...` and `golangci-lint run` (for Go code)
   - All unit tests pass.
   - Unit test coverage **does not decrease**.

## Directory-Specific Checks

### `/docs` changes

- Run `npm run dev` to validate dev-mode rendering.
- Run `npm run build` to confirm production build passes.

### `/src` (Go code) changes

- Run `go build ./...` to verify build success.
- Run `golangci-lint run` to ensure style compliance.
- Run all unit tests (`go test ./...`).
- Ensure code coverage is maintained or improved.

---

## Code Style and Tooling

- Use the existing formatting conventions in the repo.
- Do not introduce new dependencies without discussion.
- Avoid committing generated or temporary files.
